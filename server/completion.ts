/**
 * `done` for agents herdr loses track of on the way, and for the pane herdr has focused.
 *
 * herdr reports `done` for an agent that went back to idle while its pane was not being
 * looked at (not focused), and `idle` once it is. It follows the agent it saw working, so
 * an agent recognised from its screen and processes rather than an integration can
 * finish as plain `idle`: an omo pane reads `pi/working`, then `claude/unknown` while
 * omo's claude child runs, then `claude/idle` (live-traced with omo 5.0), and the
 * working agent herdr knew never finished. The sidebar said READY, and no alert came.
 *
 * herdr's focus is also no sign that anyone saw a finish. It is the pane its terminal
 * last had in front, and it stays there while the user works from a browser or a phone,
 * which never move it: an agent finishing in that pane finished as plain `idle`, READY
 * and no alert, whoever was looking.
 *
 * So each pane's "worked since it was last idle" is kept here, and an idle that follows
 * work is reported as `done` until the pane works again or focus moves onto it (`seen`):
 * what herdr itself reports for an agent it did not lose in a pane it has not in front.
 * And the `unknown` in between, while another agent is there, is reported as `working`
 * (omo's whole turn read `claude/unknown` after `pi/working`, and the sidebar showed no RUN).
 *
 * The agent that worked reading `unknown` itself is a finish, not more work: Codex, which
 * herdr follows through its integration, reads `codex/working` for a turn and then
 * `codex/unknown` at rest (live, herdr 0.9.3). Reported as working, every Codex pane that
 * ever worked read RUN for good, and no done alert came.
 *
 * herdr keeps its own `done` across a restart of this server; what is kept here was lost
 * with it, and every omo or gjc pane that had finished read READY again after an update.
 * So the finished panes are kept in a file too, for the herdr they were seen in: a herdr
 * started anew reuses pane ids for other panes, and its socket is then another file. The
 * panes still working are not: what became of them while this server was down (finished,
 * and seen at herdr's terminal?) is unknown, and a DONE nobody needs is an alert too.
